# Stock Market

We are creating a database on the stock market for 10+ sectors like healthcare, FMCG, and insurance. This database will aid in improving stock market comprehension for new investors. It will have the potential to help them make decisions about which stocks to buy or sell by offering peer comparisons of stocks.

### Project Features ###

* Our database predicts the stock trend of specific companies by providing the target company's market capitalization, return over the years, market valuation, etc.
* This database will compare dividends, profit, sales, and return on investment of peer companies to help new investors buy potential stocks or sell underperforming stocks.

### Steps Followed ###

* The initial phase involved obtaining the dataset from Yahoo Finance, which consisted of 53 companies overall and 10 different sectors.
* The second step involved web scraping from Twitter to hunt for news relevant to the stock market.
* The third step involved carrying out data cleansing procedures and displaying data visualization graphs. The processes for cleaning the data included managing null values and duplicate values.
* The fourth stage was to examine the table for normalizations to see if they were in the first, second, or third normal form.
