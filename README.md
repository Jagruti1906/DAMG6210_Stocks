# Stock Market

We are creating a database on the stock market for various sectors like healthcare, FMCG, and insurance. This database will aid in improving stock market comprehension for new investors. It will have the potential to help them decide which stocks to buy or sell by offering peer comparisons of stocks. The database will let investors shortlist equities, add them to their watchlists, and ultimately help them make decisions.

### Project Features ###

* Our database predicts the stock trend of specific companies by providing the target company's yearly graph, market capitalization, return over the years, market valuation, etc.
* Use historical P/E data to judge whether the current stock price of the company is overvalued or undervalued, as a reference for trading points.
* The turnover rate is provided to reflect the trading activity in different periods to predict the possible rise or fall.
* This database will compare dividends, profit, sales, and return on investment of peer companies to help new investors buy potential stocks or sell underperforming stocks.
